--Objects are all generated using 3ds Max 2017, and its inbuilt Maxscript--

--Scripts, objects and in depth manual available on github: https://github.com/att-circ-contrl/Quaddles-Gen



--In order to create the 16 object set, the "Main_Script" needs to be run by pressing ctrl+e
--The Main script makes reference to a table in a text file called "object_table" in which
--each object is specificied as a binary code (ex; 0 1 1 1). The main script runs through
--each line of this table, generating all the objects specified by the rows.

--IMPORTANT--
--In order to make the objects, you need to change the "objTable" path in the script to where you've placed the object_table.txt file.
--If you don't specify an object table, the script will generate all possible objects that you specify in the variables objvals and dims

--OTHER PATHS THAT NEED TO BE CHANGED IN SCRIPT--
--"sysInfo.currentdir" --> Current directory. Set this to the folder where all the scripts are.
--"textureMainPath" --> Location of where texture of object bodies and arms are placed
--"savePath" --> Location of where you want objects and pictures/videos saved

--NOTE: Make sure to put double slashes in path locations (for example; "C:\\Users\\Milad\\Documents" instead of "C:\Users\Milad\Documents)
--NOTE: MAKE SURE THAT ALL SCRIPTS ARE IN SAME FOLDER.

--A NOTE ABOUT SETTING FEATURE DIMENSIONS AND VALUES--
--In "Main_Script.ms" you will also find two variables called "dims" and "vals". These are the variables that you will need to use in order to --generate your object set. By default they are set to create all 16 objects in the base set, and if you wish to only make these, than you can --simply leave the script as is.
--Here are all the possible feature dimensions that can currently be input (these are the strings you can input into "dims"):
--	-Body
--	-Colour
--	-Pattern
--	-Arm_Angle
--	-Arm_Ends
--	-Smoothness
--	-Transparency	
--	-Hat
--	-ArmCount
--	-Pattern_Inversion
--For each of these feature dimensions, the following feature values are available (these are the strings you input into the variable "vals" --for the corresponding "dims" value):
--Body:		Pyramidal, Oblong, Compressed_Oblong, Octahedron, Cubic, Spherical, Concave, Convex, Dumbbell, Pepper
--Colour:		More_Red, More_Orange
--Pattern:	Diamond, Checkered
--Arm_Angle:	Bent_Up, Bent_Down, Straight
--Arm_Ends:	Pointed, Blunt, Flat, Flared, Spherical
--Smoothness:	Smooth, Wrinkled, Inward_Protrusions, Outward_Protrusions, Blocky, Hairy
--Transparency:	Opaque, Transparent
--Hat:		Pyramidal, Oblong, Compressed_Oblong, Octahedron, Cubic, Spherical, Concave, Convex, Dumbbell, Pepper
--ArmCount:	0,1,2,3,4
--Pattern_Inversion:	Inverted, Normal
