--HELP PAGE--


--In order to create the 16 object set, the "Main_Script" needs to be run by pressing ctrl+e
--The Main script makes reference to a table in a text file called "object_table" in which
--each object is specificied as a binary code (ex; 0 1 1 1). The main script runs through
--each line of this table, generating all the objects specified by the rows.

--IMPORTANT--
--In order to make the objects, you need to change the "objTable" path in the script to where you've placed the object_table.txt file.
--If you don't specify an object table, the script will generate all possible objects

--OTHER PATHS THAT NEED TO BE CHANGED IN SCRIPT--
--"sysInfo.currentdir" --> Current directory. Set this to the folder where all the scripts are.
--"textureMainPath" --> Location of where texture of object bodies and arms are placed
--"savePath" --> Location of where you want objects and pictures/videos saved

--NOTE: Make sure to put double slashes in path locations (for example; "C:\\Users\\Milad\\Documents" instead of "C:\Users\Milad\Documents)

--NOTE: MAKE SURE THAT ALL SCRIPTS ARE IN SAME FOLDER.
